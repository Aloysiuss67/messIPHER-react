# messIPHER-react
A messaging app for iOS build in react native

This app was designed for a first exposure to react native. The messaging app behaves as you'd expect a messaging app to behave. However, there is one point of difference. Within the app the user can chose to send a 'locked' message. When a locked message is sent, it will show up on the recievers screen as a fake message, "I'll see you at lunch". For the reciever to view this message in it's true form they must confirm their pin number. This allows the sender more certainity that their message is not being viewed by the wrong eyes.

This app takes inspiration from friends and family who refuse to lock their phones.
